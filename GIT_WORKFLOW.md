# Git Workflow Strategy for Network Monitoring Project

## Branch Structure

### ðŸš€ `main` (Production/Cloud Deploy)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code for cloud deployment
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to Render
- **Code Quality**: Must be stable, tested, and documented
- **Protected**: Only merge through pull requests

### ðŸ”§ `development` 
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for new features
- **Use**: Merge completed features before production
- **Testing**: Run full test suite before merging to main

### ðŸ’» `local-testing`
- **Purpose**: Local development and experimentation
- **Use**: Day-to-day development work
- **Freedom**: Can have debug code, local-only configurations

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Daily Development
```bash
# Work on local-testing branch
git checkout local-testing
# Make your changes, test locally
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin local-testing
```

### 2. Feature Complete
```bash
# Merge to development for integration testing
git checkout development
git merge local-testing
git push origin development
```

### 3. Ready for Production
```bash
# Create pull request: development â†’ main
# After review and testing, merge to main
git checkout main
git merge development
git push origin main
# This triggers automatic deployment to Render
```

## Migration Plan for Your Local Folder

### Option A: Copy Local Changes to Branches
1. Copy your local testing folder contents to `local-testing` branch
2. Keep important features in `development` 
3. Keep `main` as clean production version

### Option B: Start Fresh
1. Use current cloud version as your base
2. Re-implement local testing features gradually
3. Follow the new branch workflow

## Benefits of This Approach

âœ… **Professional**: Follows industry standards
âœ… **Portfolio Ready**: Clean main branch for employers
âœ… **Deployment**: Automatic cloud deployment from main
âœ… **Safety**: Protected production branch
âœ… **Flexibility**: Freedom to experiment in local-testing
âœ… **Collaboration**: Easy to add team members later

## Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# Switch to local development
git checkout local-testing

# Switch to integration testing  
git checkout development

# Switch to production code
git checkout main

# See all branches
git branch -a

# Current branch status
git status
```
