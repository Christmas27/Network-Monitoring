5. **Docker-based labs** (Lightest weight) - Free, custom solutions

## 💡 My Recommendation:

**Start with Containerlab + Docker lab** (both free) for these reasons:

### Containerlab Benefits:
- ✅ **Completely free** and open source
- ✅ **Lightweight** - Uses containers instead of VMs
- ✅ **Fast startup** - Lab ready in seconds, not minutes
- ✅ **Automation native** - YAML topology definitions
- ✅ **Real network stacks** - Uses actual vendor network OS containers
- ✅ **CI/CD friendly** - Perfect for testing automation scripts

### Why Containerlab > EVE-NG/GNS3 for your project:
1. **Speed**: Lab creation/destruction in seconds
2. **Resources**: Much lighter on CPU/RAM
3. **Automation**: YAML topology files, scriptable
4. **Modern**: Built for DevOps/automation workflows
5. **Free**: No licensing concerns ever

## 🚀 Quick Start Recommendation:

```bash
# Install Containerlab (Linux/WSL)
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.containerlab.dev)"

# Create lab topology (YAML file)
# Deploy lab
containerlab deploy -t topology.yml

# Destroy lab
containerlab destroy -t topology.yml
```

**Bottom line**: For your network automation project, use **Containerlab** first (free, fast, automation-focused), then **EVE-NG Community** if you need more complex scenarios.
