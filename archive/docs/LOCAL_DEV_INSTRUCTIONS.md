# ðŸ”§ Quick Setup Guide for Local Development Session

## For the AI Assistant in Local Development:

### Context:
I'm working on enhancing my Network Monitoring Dashboard with Ansible automation features. The production version is deployed at https://network-monitoring-dashboard-uifb.onrender.com/ and the GitHub repository is Christmas27/Network-Monitoring.

### Current Status:
- âœ… Production deployment complete on Render
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline working with GitHub Actions
- âœ… Full network monitoring functionality operational
- ðŸŽ¯ Ready to add Ansible automation features

### What I Need Help With:
1. **Setting up Ansible integration** in my local development environment
2. **Creating the modules** described in DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
3. **Building the automation features** step by step
4. **Testing with virtual network devices** (GNS3 or similar)

### My Current Local Setup:
- Python 3.11+ with virtual environment
- Existing Flask application with all dependencies
- Git repository synchronized with GitHub
- VS Code with necessary extensions

### Goal:
Implement the Ansible automation features locally, test thoroughly, then bring the completed code back to the cloud deployment session for production deployment.

### Key Files to Reference:
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Complete implementation plan
- `ANSIBLE_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md` - Technical details
- Existing codebase structure for integration patterns

### Next Steps:
1. Start with Phase 1 of the roadmap
2. Install Ansible dependencies
3. Create the ansible_manager.py module
4. Build incrementally following the 4-week plan

Please help me implement these Ansible automation features following the detailed roadmap provided!
