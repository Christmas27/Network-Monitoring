# âœ… Agent Handoff Checklist
## Everything You Need for Successful Deployment

### ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Checklist

#### Files Provided:
- [ ] **Application Package**: `network-monitoring-deployment/` (clean, production-ready)
- [ ] **Deployment Archive**: `network-monitoring-deployment.zip` (for easy upload)
- [ ] **Deployment Brief**: Understanding of what you're deploying
- [ ] **Project Context**: How the application works and why Oracle Cloud
- [ ] **Oracle Cloud Guide**: Step-by-step deployment instructions
- [ ] **Configuration Examples**: Environment variables and setup templates

#### Information Confirmed:
- [ ] **Target Platform**: Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (Always Free Tier)
- [ ] **Architecture**: ARM-based VM.Standard.A1.Flex (2 OCPU, 12GB RAM)
- [ ] **Budget**: $0 (using always-free resources)
- [ ] **Timeline**: Deploy as soon as possible
- [ ] **Access Requirements**: HTTP/HTTPS inbound, SSH/SNMP outbound

### ðŸš€ Deployment Process Checklist

#### Phase 1: Oracle Cloud Setup
- [ ] Create Oracle Cloud account (requires credit card for verification)
- [ ] Choose home region (closest to user location)
- [ ] Create compartment for organization
- [ ] Provision VM.Standard.A1.Flex instance
  - [ ] 2 OCPU ARM processors
  - [ ] 12 GB RAM
  - [ ] 50 GB boot volume
  - [ ] Ubuntu 22.04 LTS image
- [ ] Configure Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)
- [ ] Set up Internet Gateway
- [ ] Configure Security Groups:
  - [ ] SSH (port 22)
  - [ ] HTTP (port 80)
  - [ ] HTTPS (port 443)
  - [ ] Streamlit (port 8501)
- [ ] Generate and download SSH key pair
- [ ] Test SSH connection to VM

#### Phase 2: Server Preparation
- [ ] Connect to VM via SSH
- [ ] Update system packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
- [ ] Install Docker: `curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sudo sh get-docker.sh`
- [ ] Add user to docker group: `sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu`
- [ ] Install Docker Compose
- [ ] Test Docker installation: `docker --version && docker-compose --version`

#### Phase 3: Application Deployment
- [ ] Upload deployment package to VM:
  - [ ] Option A: `scp -r network-monitoring-deployment/ ubuntu@<vm-ip>:~/`
  - [ ] Option B: `scp network-monitoring-deployment.zip ubuntu@<vm-ip>:~/`
- [ ] Extract if using archive: `unzip network-monitoring-deployment.zip`
- [ ] Navigate to application directory: `cd network-monitoring-deployment`
- [ ] Review configuration files:
  - [ ] Copy environment template: `cp .env.example .env`
  - [ ] Edit environment variables: `nano .env`
  - [ ] Review Docker configuration: `cat docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Deploy application: `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Check container status: `docker-compose ps`
- [ ] View logs if needed: `docker-compose logs`

#### Phase 4: Verification & Testing
- [ ] Access application in browser: `http://<vm-ip>:8501`
- [ ] Verify all 7 pages load correctly:
  - [ ] Dashboard page
  - [ ] Devices page
  - [ ] Automation page
  - [ ] Security page
  - [ ] Configuration page
  - [ ] Monitoring page
  - [ ] Topology page
- [ ] Test basic functionality:
  - [ ] Add a test device (if network devices available)
  - [ ] Check database connections
  - [ ] Verify logging is working
- [ ] Check resource usage: `docker stats`
- [ ] Verify memory usage is within limits

#### Phase 5: Production Setup (Optional)
- [ ] Configure custom domain (if required)
- [ ] Set up SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt
- [ ] Configure Nginx reverse proxy
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement backup procedures
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Document access procedures for end users

### ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Checklist

#### Common Issues & Solutions:
- [ ] **Container won't start**: Check `docker-compose logs` for errors
- [ ] **Permission denied**: Ensure user is in docker group, logout/login
- [ ] **Port conflicts**: Verify ports 8501, 80, 443 are available
- [ ] **Memory issues**: Monitor with `free -h` and `docker stats`
- [ ] **ARM compatibility**: All dependencies are pre-tested for ARM64
- [ ] **Network access**: Check Oracle Cloud security group rules
- [ ] **SSH issues**: Verify SSH key permissions (600) and correct IP

#### Performance Optimization:
- [ ] Monitor memory usage (should be well under 12GB limit)
- [ ] Check disk space usage
- [ ] Review application logs for any warnings
- [ ] Test concurrent user access
- [ ] Verify database performance

### ðŸ“ž Support & Escalation

#### Documentation References:
- [ ] **Primary guide**: `deploy/ORACLE_CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] **Architecture details**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] **API documentation**: `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- [ ] **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions documented

#### When to Escalate:
- [ ] Oracle Cloud account creation issues
- [ ] ARM compatibility problems (very unlikely)
- [ ] Application-specific functionality questions
- [ ] Custom configuration requirements beyond standard setup

### âœ… Deployment Success Criteria

#### Application Running Successfully:
- [ ] Dashboard accessible at `http://<vm-ip>:8501`
- [ ] All pages load without errors
- [ ] No memory or performance warnings
- [ ] Container shows as "healthy" in docker status
- [ ] Logs show normal operation

#### Oracle Cloud Configuration:
- [ ] VM instance running and accessible
- [ ] Security groups properly configured
- [ ] Resource usage within always-free limits
- [ ] Monitoring enabled (optional)
- [ ] Backup procedures in place (optional)

#### Project Completion:
- [ ] End user access verified
- [ ] Documentation handoff completed
- [ ] Monitoring and maintenance procedures established
- [ ] Project marked as successfully deployed
