## 🏗️ Target Architecture

### Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Setup:
```
🌐 Internet
    ↓
🔒 OCI Security Group (HTTP/HTTPS/SSH)
    ↓
🖥️  VM.Standard.A1.Flex (ARM)
    ├── 2 OCPU (ARM64)
    ├── 12 GB RAM
    ├── 50 GB Boot Volume
    └── Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
        ├── 🐳 Docker Engine
        ├── 🐳 Docker Compose
        └── 📱 Streamlit App (Port 8501)
```
