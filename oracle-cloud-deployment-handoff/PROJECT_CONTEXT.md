## Network Monitoring Dashboard

### 🎯 What This Application Does

The Network Monitoring Dashboard is a **comprehensive network management platform** built with modern Python technologies. It serves as a central hub for network administrators to:

#### Core Capabilities:
1. **Device Discovery & Management**
   - Add network devices (routers, switches, firewalls)
   - Test SSH connectivity and credentials
   - Maintain device inventory with status tracking

2. **Security & Compliance**
   - Run vulnerability scans on network infrastructure
   - Check compliance against security standards
   - Generate security reports and recommendations

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Deploy configuration templates to devices
   - Backup and restore device configurations
   - Standardize network device setups

4. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Monitor device availability and performance
   - Track network metrics and statistics
   - Alert on connectivity issues

5. **Network Automation**
   - Execute Ansible playbooks for network tasks
   - Automate repetitive network operations
   - Integrate with enterprise network tools
