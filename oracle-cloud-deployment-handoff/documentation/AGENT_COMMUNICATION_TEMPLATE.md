## 🔍 Platform Research Checklist

Before contacting deployment agents, research:

### For Each Platform:
- [ ] **Free tier limits** (compute hours, storage, bandwidth)
- [ ] **Pricing after free tier** (monthly estimates)
- [ ] **Container deployment options** (serverless vs VMs)
- [ ] **Database storage solutions** (managed vs file storage)
- [ ] **Documentation quality** (clear tutorials available?)
- [ ] **Community support** (Stack Overflow, Reddit discussions)

### Test Questions:
- [ ] Can I deploy a simple container easily?
- [ ] How do I handle persistent file storage?
- [ ] What's the simplest CI/CD option?
- [ ] How do I manage environment variables?
- [ ] Can I set up a custom domain?
